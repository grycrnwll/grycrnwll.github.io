In this paper a mixture distribution model is extended to include spatial dependence of the autoregressive type.
 The resulting model nests both spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence as special cases. A data generation
 process is outlined that incorporates both a finite mixture of normal distributions and spatial dependence.
 Whether group assignment is completely random by nature or displays some locational “pattern”, the proposed
 spatial-mix estimation procedure is always able to recover the true parameters. As an illustration, a basic
 hedonic price model is investigated that includes sub-groups of data with heterogeneous coefficients in addition
 to spatially clustered elements.
